# PowerGridForm Component

This workspace contains a small Vite + React scaffold and the `PowerGridForm` component.

Local run (Vite) — recommended for cross-device use

1. From PowerShell in `d:\SIH-2 pro`:

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

2. Open the address shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173).

Deploy options (so it works on all devices)

- Vercel: connect the GitHub repo and Vercel will detect Vite and build automatically (or set build command `npm run build` and output directory `dist`).
- Netlify: same — set build command `npm run build` and publish `dist`.
- CodeSandbox / StackBlitz: you can import the repo or create a new sandbox and paste `src/PowerGridForm.jsx` for instant sharing.

If you want, I can scaffold a GitHub repo and Vercel config and test a build here.
